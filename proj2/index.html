    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      Throughout this project, we explored mesh operations such as splitting,
      flipping, upsampling, and more. We implemented these operations in each
      stage of our project, and saw our mesh editor evolve and support more
      functions after each part. In the first section, we started by doing
      operations on a simple Bezier curve with 4 control points, then moved onto
      Bezier patches. In the second section, we worked with triangle meshes to
      perform more advanced operations such as smooth shading, flipping edges,
      splitting edges and loop subdivision. We definitely endured our fair share
      of ups and downs, particularly in Section 2 when we had to traverse the
      mesh and reassign several pointers for flipping and splitting. These
      operations' implementations were time consuming and required lots of
      debugging. However, it was extremeley satisfying seeing the fruits of our
      labour reflected on the GUI, as it got us closer and closer to higher
      resolution, smoothly rendered 3D objects. All in all, we thoroughly
      enjoyed working together to implemented mesh editing, and it taught us a
      lot about the operations that are currently supported in softwares like
      Adobe Illustrator, Autodesk, and Blender.

    <h1>Section I: Bezier Curves and Surfaces</h1>

    <h2>Part 1</h2>
    <p>
      De Casteljau's algorithm is a technique that allows us to evaluate Bezier
      curves. Bezier curves by definition have two endpoints and a number of
      control points on the curve. For de Casteljau, curves with less control
      points are ideal, since more points (and a higher-degree curve) are more
      difficult to interpolate.
    </p>
    <p>
      First, the algorithm does linear interpolation between pairs of adjacent
      points and lays down a new control point on each edge. Since the algorithm
      is recursive, this step is repeated, and a new control point is placed on
      each new edge until there is only one point left.
    </p>
    <p>
      For part 1, we implemented the function <code>evaluateStep()</code>, which
      inputs the most recent set of control points and finds the next level. In
      <code>evaluateStep()</code>, the algorithm iterates over the control
      points (<code>points</code>), checking if the size of the levels evaluated
      are equal to the number of control points, and computes the weighted
      average of its neighbouring points, using the parameter 't' and the
      formula for linear interpolation (lerp) defined by de Casteljau: We store
      intermediate points found in a 2D vector called
      <code>intermediate</code> and return it as the output of the function. In
      this way, the most recent level of control points is stored in
      <code>intermediate</code> and updated each time the function is called.

    <h2>Part 2</h2>
    <p>
      Building off the concept of Bezier curves, we will now extend the idea to
      add another dimension. Bezier surfaces are also defined by a set of
      control points, where a Bezier surface patch consists of 4x4 control
      points. To visualize or implement this, we can imagine having 4 curves in
      the u-direction, or 4x1 control points in the u-direction. Then, we can
      define 4 more control points in the v-direction as "moving curves", which
      are essentially sweeping out the 2D surface / connecting the 4 curves made
      in the u direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      To implement our Bezier surfaces, we extended off our code from Part 1. To
      evaluate a Bezier patch for a position <code>(u, v)</code> on the Bezier
      surface, we can use the 1D de Casteljau algorithm. First, we started by
      finding 4 u-points in one direction, specifically for each curve in the
      u-direction. After, we use these points to find the control points in the
      v-direction for the moving curve.

    <h1>Section II: Sampling</h1>

    <h2>Part 3</h2>
    <p>
      In Part 3, we were tasked with implementing area-weighted vertex normals
      to use for Phong shading. This allows us to better shade smooth surfaces
      as it produces the "smoothing" effect by performing linear interpolations
      on the vertex normals as opposed to face normals.
    </p>
    <p>
      In order to compute an area-weighted normal for a given vertex, we first
      iterated through the faces incident to the vertex and found the face
      normal multiplied by the face's area for each face. We found the area from
      the Vertex positions for that face. We then added the weighted face normal
      to the norm sum (which we initilized to be 0). After iterating through all
      the faces, we then averaged the norm sum by dividing by the number of
      faces and returned the normalized norm sum.

    <h2>Part 4</h2>
    <p>
      To implement the edge flip operation, which essentially performs the
      function of flipping an edge, we started by outlining our approach as
      needing to reassign a bunch of pointers for halfedges, vertices, edges,
      and faces, to a new set of correct halfedges, vertices, edges, and faces.
      We then proceeded to jot down and initialize all the pointers necessary,
      using a diagram to keep track of all the halfedges, faces, vertices,
      face's edges, and corresponding halfedges that we need to update,
      illustrating what it should look like before and after the flip. Then, we
      started to reassign everything carefully, according to the diagrams drawn.
      This was definitely a very tedious process, and we had to go back and redo
      some reassignments due to typos or wrong pointers, but eventually we were
      able to reassign everything mostly correctly. To debug, we ran through the
      code multiple times to figure out if we missed a pointer or assigned one
      incorrectly by mistake. After a few iterations of this, we ended up with a
      working edge flip! Finally, we also identified an edge case where we
      checked if the edge is a boundary, in which we return right away.
      Thankfully, we didn't need to endure too much debugging for this part, but
      Part 5 was definitely an interesting experience...

    <h2>Part 5</h2>
    <p>
      After implementing the edge flip, we then implemented the edge split
      operation. The first step in the implementation process for this operation
      was drawing a diagram with every edge, vertex, face, and half edge labled
      before and after the edge split operation. Similarly to edge flip, it was
      then a matter of updating pointers and creating new mesh elements if
      needed. We created the diagrams (shown below) to help us keep track of
      pointers and new mesh elements added. This was super critical to our
      process as it helped us debug and ensure we were updating the correct
      pointers.

      </div>
    </div>

    <br />
    <br />
    <p>
      This problem was also very tedious to debug! We checked our diagrams and
      code many many times and ensured our pointers were updated correctly.
      However, just like task 4, we had to redo the implementation a few times
      before getting everything right. Debugging part 5 was especially tedious
      due to it having many more elements to handle, and new mesh elements to
      take into consideration. This made it extra confusing to keep track of,
      and we ran into segfaulting issues after typing out our intitial attempt.
      We tried cross-checking our diagram and implementation but couldn't find
      the error.
    </p>
    <p>
      After our first try, we decided to restart and redo how we assigned and
      labelled everything, in attempt to clean up our code and catch the
      mistakes. On our second try, we utilized our new reference diagrams and
      defined our initial mesh elements carefully, making sure to pay special
      attention to the
      <code>setNeighbors()</code> function to ensure that we update the new
      pointers correctly. After typing everything out, the code didn't segfault,
      but now we were running into issues where our split operation was causing
      gaps in the mesh. We figured that this was likely due to not assigning the
      pointers correctly somewhere in our code, so we went through the code
      multiple times and eventually found around 4 bugs / wrong assignments that
      fixed our splitting functionality. Our errors had to do with
      misinterpretting the direction of our pointers and small mistakes in our
      diagram not matching up to the code.

    <h2>Part 6</h2>
    <p>
      For our implementation of the loop subdivision algorithm, we used our
      implementation of edge splitting and flipped those that touched both an
      old and new edge. The outcome is a smoother mesh that looks higher
      quality/resolution since we are increasing the number of triangles in the
      input
      <code>mesh</code> and is more round.
    </p>
    <p>
      We started by finding new positions of all the vertices in the input mesh
      and then storing them in <code>newPosition</code> for each of the
      <code>EdgeIter</code> elements in the mesh. We calculated the position by
      using the formula <code>3/8 * (A + B) + 1/8 * (C + D)</code> where (A, B)
      is the edge that the new vertex will be splitting and (C, D) are the
      remaining vertices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then, we iterated through the <code>VertexIter</code> elements in the mesh
      and calculated the updated positions of the old vertices and store them in
      <code>newPosition</code>. We found the position using the formula
      <code
        >(1 - n * u) * original_position + u *
        original_neighbor_position_sum</code
      >
      where <code>n</code> is the degree of the vertex, <code>u</code> is a
      constant equal to 3/16 if n=3 and 3/8n otherwise,
      <code>original_position</code> is the original position of the old vertex,
      and <code>original_neighbor_position_sum</code>
      is the sum of original positions of original neghbors to that vertex.
    </p>
    <p>
      After we've calculated and stored those values, we then split every edge
      in the mesh and mark the new edges as new within <code>splitEdge</code>.
      We also have to set the new vertex's position equal to the position
      calculated earlier for that edge. Once the edges are split, we can then
      flip all the new edges that connect an old and new vertex. Finally, we end
      by coping the new vertex positions into the final
      <code>Vertex::position</code> field for each <code>VertexIter</code>.

    <br /><br />

    <p>
      Loop subdivision evidently (as seen above) has the effect of rounding out
      or smoothing the object, which is especially clear in the images above
      when we render the cube. Another observation is that when we upsample, the
      volume of the entire 3D object shrinks. We noticed that when we increased
      upsampling multiple times, the shape starts to become more bumpy and less
      symmetrical than the original cube. This is due to the fact that the
      initial cube mesh we start with is only using a single edge to split cube
      faces assymetrically. To fix this, we would preprocess the mesh by edge
      splitting along the flat faces of the cube, to maintain the original
      cubical shape. When we upsample after this, the cube will look more
      symmetrical.

    <p>
      In order to try and mediate the asymmetry from repeated subdivisions on
      the cube mesh, we can preprocess the cube through edge flips or splits
      before peforming the subdivision. We thought that this asymmetry might
      have come from the edges in the cube facing different directions, so in
      order to preprocess the cube we split each edge that divides each face of
      the cube so it looks as follows:

      This method actually worked pretty well, and we were able to acieve the
      images below of a symmetric cube from this process!
