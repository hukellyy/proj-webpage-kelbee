    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <h3>
      In Project 3-2, we implemented additional material rendering for our ray
      tracer from Project 3-1 by computing the BSDF for an intersection point on
      glass, mirror, and microfacet surfaces. Now, we are able to render objects
      made from glass, mirror, or microfacet materials!
    </h3>
    <h2>Part 1: Mirror and Glass Materials</h2>
    <h3>
      Show a sequence of six images of scene CBspheres.dae rendered with
      max_ray_depth set to 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 100. The other settings should
      be at least 64 samples per pixel and 4 samples per light. Make sure to
      include all screenshots.

    <h3>Point out the new multibounce effects that appear in each image.</h3>
    <p>
      When there are zero bounces of light, the image renders a black screen
      since we are just calculating the light that comes from the light source
      itself. After adding a bounce of light, we are able to render the walls
      and the spheres, but the spheres look black. They each have a patch of
      white because the spheres are now reflective, so after one bounce there is
      still a reflection from the area light because the light hits that surface
      of sphere and reflects with only once bounce.
    </p>
    <p>
      After two bounces of light, the sphere in the back is able to reflect the
      other sphere since the light hits of the area light onto the sphere and
      then outwards towards the rest of the scene. The sphere in the front is
      beginning to show some reflection as well but since it is also refractive
      it is not able to fully render the material with only two bounces.
      Additionally, in the reflection for the sphere in the back the roof and
      back wall are black still as well as the other sphere in the reflection.
    </p>
    <p>
      At three bounces of light the refractive sphere in the front is able to
      render much better. The reflection for the left sphere also looks better,
      the back wall and sphere is still black, but the roof is now lit from the
      third bounce.
    </p>
    <p>
      After four bounces of light, there is now a patch of light on the right
      wall from the refraction from the right sphere from the fourth bounce. For
      the sphere on the left, the right sphere is now lit up in the reflection
      but the back wall is still black.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are not many changes between 4 and 5 bounces, but the right sphere
      in the reflection of the left sphere shows the relfection of the area
      light much better. Additionally, the spot on the wall from the right
      sphere looks a little brighter from the additional light. Another
      interesting thing is that the quality appears to be getting worse from the
      3 to 5 bounce images since I am keeping the sample size the same for all
      three images.
    </p>
    <p>
      For m=100, the image doesn't look much different, however due to the
      additional bounces of light you can see somme speckling in the reflection
      of the area light on the right sphere and more speckling next to the white
      circle under the right sphere.
    </p>
    <br />
    <h3>
      Explain how these bounce numbers relate to the particular effects that
      appear. Make sure to include all screenshots.
    </h3>
    <p>
      As I mentioned earlier, the zero bounce renders a black screen becasue it
      is only calculating light for zero bounces--just the light source.
    </p>
    <p>
      For 1 bounce of light, it is calculating the light from the ceiling to the
      point of intersection from the area light on the top reflective surface of
      the sphere back to the camera.
    </p>
    <p>
      For 2 bounces of light we are able to calculate the light from the area
      light to the top surface of the sphere to the bottom surface of the sphere
      back to the camera.
    </p>
    <p>
      For 3 bounces of light we are able to calculate the light from the area
      light to the top surface of the sphere to the bottom surface of the sphere
      to the floor back to the camera.
    </p>
    <p>
      For 3 bounces of light we are able to calculate the light from the area
      light to the top surface of the sphere to the bottom surface of the sphere
      to the floor back to the camera.
    </p>
    <p>
      For 4 bounces of light we are able to calculate the light from the area
      light to the top surface of the sphere to the bottom surface of the sphere
      to the floor to the right wall (for the right sphere) and to the right
      sphere (for the left sphere) back to the camera.
    </p>
    <p>
      For 5 bounces of light it has the same bounces as up to 4, but on the
      fifth bounce it bounces back up towards the roof making the whole scene
      look a little brighter, and in the left sphere it is also able to capture
      the bounce of light from the area light onto the right sohere in the
      reflection much better.
    </p>
    <p>
      For 100 bounces of light, it is calculating repeated bounces cast from the
      reflections and refractions, so that is why the speckling appears more
      prominently in the right image as mentioned above.
    </p>

    <h2>Part 2: Microfacet Material</h2>
    <h3>
      Show a screenshot sequence of 4 images of scene CBdragon_microfacet_au.dae
      rendered with α set to 0.005, 0.05, 0.25 and 0.5. The other settings
      should be at least 128 samples per pixel and 1 samples per light. The
      number of bounces should be at least 5. Describe the differences between
      different images. Note that, to change the α, just open the .dae file and
      search for microfacet.
    </h3>
    <p></p>

    <h3>
      Show two images of scene CBbunny_microfacet_cu.dae rendered using cosine
      hemisphere sampling (default) and your importance sampling. The sampling
      rate should be fixed at 64 samples per pixel and 1 samples per light. The
      number of bounces should be at least 5. Briefly discuss their difference.

      modifying them arbitrarily. Tell us what kind of material your parameters
