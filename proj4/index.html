    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>
      In Project 4, we successfully implemented a cloth simulator that uses a point mass and spring model. 
      In this project, we had to implement Verlet integration for cloth movement, handle collisions with 
      the cloth itself or other objects in the scene, and implement various vertex shaders to render various
      material and lighting effects. This project was very interesting, but also challenging--especially when it 
      came to implementing self-collision handling. That part of the project was difficult as it required a lot of
      thought in implementing the best hash function and deriving the correction vector. We tried many hash functions
      until we found one that worked effectively for us! However, completing this project was very rewarding as 
      the cloth simulator began to appear more and more realistic as we completed parts of the project.

      clearly see the cloth wireframe to show the structure of your point masses and 
      springs.

    <h2>Part 2: Simulation via numerical integration</h2>
    <h3>
      Experiment with some the parameters in the simulation. To do so, pause the simulation 
      at the start with P, modify the values of interest, and then resume by pressing P again. 
      You can also restart the simulation at any time from the cloth's starting position by 
      pressing R.
    </h3>
    <h3>
      Describe the effects of changing the spring constant ks; how does the cloth behave from 
      start to rest with a very low ks? A high ks?
    </h3>
    <p>
      We can think of ks (the spring constant) as determining how flexible versus stagnant our spring is. With a 
      smaller ks, we have a bouncier, more flexible spring. With a larger ks, we have a much less flexible spring. 
      When I played around with differnt ks values, setting it to a lower number like 35 made the cloth super 
      seemingly stretchy and flowy, while setting to a higher number made it a lot more rigid. The magnitude of ks 
      definitely makes the cloth seem like it's made of varying strengthes/durabilities of material. In terms of visual 
      differences, we could discern these details through noticing smaller folds and wrinkles in the cloths with 
      smaller ks values (see ks = 35), and singular large folds in the higher values (see ks = 10000).

    <h3>
      What about for density?
    </h3>
    <p>
      When we think of density, lower values make the cloth look/feel lighter while higher values make it feel 
      a lot more heavy (can also be obviously described as "dense"). Specifically, we tried setting the density to 1000, and the fabric 
      draped down in a way where it seemed to experience more gravity or pulling, almost like it was heavier. 
      When we set it to a low value of 2, there were a significant difference in the size of the folds and 
      wrinkles in the cloth.

    <h3>
      What about for damping?
    </h3>
    <p>
      For damping, we can think of it as loss in energy or the decreasing of amplitude of spring oscillations in 
      our system. Setting dampling values lower means that there will be less energy loss over a period of time, 
      and the oscillations will fade slower, while setting damping values higher means that there will be more 
      energy lost over a period of time, and the oscillations will fade faster. To illustrate this quantitatively, 
      when we tried making the damping param equal to 1, the cloth fell down very slowly and only ahd one 'swing'
      into its resting state. I assume this is due to the fact that the cloth is losing all its energy on its way 
      down, making it come to a stop once it is fully draped. On the other hand, when we set the damping param equal
      to 0, the cloth bounced around uncontrollably, swinging back and forth very quickly without stopping. This is due to 
      the fact that 0 damping essentially corresponds to 0 loss in energy, so the cloth does not ever go into a resting state. 
    </p>

    <h3>
      For each of the above, observe any noticeable differences in the cloth compared to the
       default parameters and show us some screenshots of those interesting differences and describe when they occur.
    </h3>

    <p>
      In comparison to the default parameters, we see more folds in the cloth when the density is increased or ks is decreased as due to the reasons explained above.
      We see less folds in the cloth when the density has been decreased or ks has been increased, and the cloth swings much slower when the damping is incresed because 
      there is a higher loss in energy. ***

    <h2>Part 3: Handling collisions with other objects</h2>
    <h3>Show us screenshots of your shaded cloth from scene/sphere.json in its final resting state 
      on the sphere using the default ks = 5000 as well as with ks = 500 and ks = 50000. Describe 
      the differences in the results.</h3>
    <p>
     With a lower ks value of 500, we can observe through the motions of the cloth falling onto the sphere 
     that the cloth has more wrinkles created when it is in its final resting state, almost as if the fabric is thinner or lighter. When we increased 
     it to 50000, the cloth in its resting state has more wrinkles and droops down less, wrapping the sphere 
     less than the default ks parameter does. With the 500 ks value, the cloth is wrapping the sphere the most 
     tightly.

      When we vary density, lower values create folds in the cloth that are larger and more voluminous compared 
      to higher values that create smaller folds that drape over each other more times. The differences in their 
      resting states can be described as lower densities having less overlapping of folds and higher densities having more 
      overlapping of folds.

    <p>
      When we vary ks, a lower value (as seen before) makes for a more flexible and springy or bouncy cloth.
      When ks a smaller value, it will tend to fold over multiple times and bounce around multiple times 
      before it comes to a resting position. Even as we observe it in its resting phase, it will begin to unfold 
      slowly. When it becomes larger, however, the fabric is more rigid and tough, making it bounch around 
      less and assume its resting position faster.

    <h2>Part 5: Shaders</h2>
    <h3>
      Explain in your own words what is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects.
    </h3>
    <p>
      GLSL Shaders are programs that can run in parallel on GPU and take in an input such as a texture file or color scheme and output a 4D vector that contains useful
      information for renering that position in the scene. These are useful because they are much faster than just rendering our scene using our CPU to do all of the 
      raytracing computation. These vertex and fragment shaders work togethe to create lighting and material effects since vertex shaders modify the geometry of the scene 
      and fragment shaders modify the color at each position in the scene. This allows our renderer to be able to simulate lighting effects on various geometries or a particular
      type of material.
    </p>
      
    <h3>
      Explain the Blinn-Phong shading model in your own words. Show a screenshot of your Blinn-Phong shader outputting only the ambient component, a screen shot only outputting
       the diffuse component, a screen shot only outputting the specular component, and one using the entire Blinn-Phong model.
    </h3>
    <p>The Blinn-Phong shading model takes into account ambient lighting, diffuse lighting, and specular highlights when computing the color for a given position. We found this color
      by implementing this equation that has each of the three lighting components as a term in the equation.
